I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Stanford University, where
I am a member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/).
I am grateful to be advised by [Chris Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/). 
My Ph.D. is generously supported by a
[National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/),
a [Stanford School of Engineering Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf),
and a [Stanford EDGE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate).

Previously, I worked for nearly two years as a software engineer at Meta,
where I used machine learning and content understanding techniques for
privacy problems in advertisements.

Before joining Meta, I graduated from Princeton University with a B.S.E. in
Computer Science and a minor in Linguistics. I was fortunate to conduct NLP
and computational linguistics research under the guidance of
[Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/fellbaum){:target="\_blank"}.
My senior thesis, which explored the language phenomenon of coordination,
won the Outstanding Senior Thesis Prize. I also received the
Phillip Goldman â€™86 Senior Prize, the CS department's top academic honor.

In my spare time, I teach [Applied Machine Learning](https://corise.com/course/applied-machine-learning)
as an instructor for CoRise. I also enjoy [acrylic painting](https://juliekallini.com/painting/)! ðŸŽ¨
