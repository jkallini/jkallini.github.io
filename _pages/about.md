I recently graduated from Princeton University with a B.S.E. in
[Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and
a minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.
I was honored to receive the Phillip Goldman ’86 Senior Prize, the top academic prize in
the Computer Science department.

At Princeton, I was fortunate to be advised by [Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fellbaum/){:target="\_blank"}
while completing research in computational linguistics. My thesis, which explored
the phenomenon of coordination through a computational approach, won the
Outstanding Senior Thesis Prize. I also worked closely with [Srinivas Bangalore](https://sbangalore.com/){:target="\_blank"}
as a teaching assistant for his Machine Translation class and won the
Outstanding Teaching Award for my work.

In the fall of 2021, I will begin working full-time as a Software Engineer at [Facebook](https://about.facebook.com/){:target="\_blank"} in Menlo Park, CA.
