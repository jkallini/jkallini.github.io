At Meta (Facebook), I use machine learning and content understanding techniques
to provide more responsible and privacy-aware advertisements across the
family of apps.

Before joining Meta, I graduated from Princeton University
with a B.S.E. in
[Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} and
a minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.
I was honored to receive the Phillip Goldman ’86 Senior Prize, the top academic prize in
the Computer Science department.

At Princeton, I was fortunate to be advised by [Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/fellbaum){:target="\_blank"}
while completing NLP and computational linguistics research. My senior thesis, which explored
the language phenomenon of coordination, won the Outstanding Senior Thesis Prize.
I also worked closely with [Srinivas Bangalore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivas-bangalore-3b8868/){:target="\_blank"}
as a teaching assistant for his Machine Translation class and won the
Outstanding Teaching Award for my work.

I'm always happy to collaborate or just chat about NLP and linguistics! \\
