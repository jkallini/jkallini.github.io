I'm Julie, and I was born and raised in **Los Angeles**. Though California is my home, I'm currently enjoying the east coast as a third-year **Computer Science Engineering** student at **Princeton University**, where I discovered the seemingly boundless possibilities of programming.

<br/>
In addition to my coursework, I have been involved in the Computer Science community at Princeton as an **Undergraduate Course Assistant** for the COS department. During my sophomore summer, I created my first **Android app** through **Facebook's** FBU internship program. Next summer, I will be returning to Facebook as a 12-week **Software Engineering Intern**.

Despite my deep interests in STEM, I have never lost touch with my artistic side. If you catch me when I'm not coding, I'm probably **painting**!
