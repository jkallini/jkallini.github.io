Last week, I graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University with a
B.S.E. in Computer Science and a minor in Linguistics. 

***

At the CS graduation ceremony, I was honored to receive [several awards](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/news/congratulations-department-computer-science-class-2021?fbclid=IwAR2mct4NnJlWBKsH5Hj53ub2J3Wv-UtRqR9UO4C3-2OhltcT2fe8wCSCRHI){:target="\_blank"}.
My senior thesis, "A Corpus-based Analysis of Two-termed Coordination," won the
Outstanding Senior Thesis Prize, and I won the Outstanding Student Teaching
Award for my work as a TA for the CS department.
Most of all, I was honored to receive the Phillip Goldman â€™86 Senior Prize
in Computer Science, the top prize and highest academic honor awarded to a
student in the Computer Science department. I was also inducted into the Tau
Beta Pi Society (the Engineering Honor Society) and the Phi Beta Kappa
Society.

When I started my first year at Princeton, I was a scared 17-year-old from
Los Angeles who had traveled across the country alone for the very first time.
I knew nothing about computer science or programming, and I was easily
intimidated by my peers, whose knowledge was difficult to match. But despite
the challenge that came with my lack of experience, I never stopped working
toward my goals and pushing myself to learn more and exceed my limits.

I have to give special thanks to [Princetonâ€™s Computer Science
Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} for
the challenging but rewarding four years and the [Program in
Linguistics](https://linguistics.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} for
helping me discover my love for language. And of course, I am so thankful for
all the friends at Princeton Iâ€™ve made along the way. Although I couldnâ€™t
celebrate with everyone in person, Iâ€™ll definitely be visiting campus
in the future!
