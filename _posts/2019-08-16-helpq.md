## **Preface**

***HelpQ*** is an **Android app** that I developed at [Facebook University (FBU) for Engineering][6] during the summer of 2019. As an intern at FBU, I
participated in three weeks of mobile development training in Android prior to working on HelpQ with my teammates, [Cassandra Cabrera][1] and [Loni Tra][2].

When coming up with app ideas, I considered my experiences as a student and an intern at FBU. In particular,
I thought that the mobile development training course would have greatly benefited from an automated help queue to streamline communication between students who need help and administrators who are available to answer questions. When I suggested this idea to my teammates and mentors, they agreed that we should develop this app as our project.


## **About the App**
<img src="../../../../../images/helpq_logo.png" width="100%">

**HelpQ** is an app that revamps the CodePath training that FBU for Engineering interns experience during the first three weeks of their internships by facilitating smoother communication between students and administrators.

HelpQ's most fundamental function is to make students' questions more **organized** and **readily available** for admins to answer. Admins can easily see students' questions in order by date and priority on the queue.
Students who have been waiting the longest appear at the top of the queue, so the admin can't miss them!

All previously answered questions are stored on a **searchable** board that is available to all students. If a student has a question that has already been asked, they can easily find its answer without having to post a new question on the queue.

If an admin sees many questions on a similar topic, they can create a **workshop** for students to attend. Students can see all the workshops in reverse-chronological order and easily sign up for them.

These are only a few of the features that HelpQ has to offer! To learn more about HelpQ's functionality, view the project on [Github][5], or continue reading below.
